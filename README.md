# üåç Global Life Quality and Economic Analysis Data Visualization Dashboardüìä

An interactive Streamlit web application allows you to explore the relationships between poverty, life expectancy, and GDP across different countries and years.

üåé **Deployed Interactive App**: [Click here to view the app](https://dsr5411.streamlit.app)


## Overview
This demo project showcases interactive dashboard development and data visualization using Streamlit and Plotly. It emphasizes building intuitive, responsive visualizations that enable users to explore global country data and analyze economic disparities across the world over time using real datasets. 

## Features
- **Interactive Scatter Plots**: Explore relationships between poverty, life expectancy, and GDP using interactive charts.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Filter data by year and country to focus on specific regions or time periods.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across devices.
- **Data Insights**: Gain insights into how economic factors affect life quality across different countries and years.      
- **ML Prediction Tool**: Random Forest model to predict life expectancy based on GDP and poverty levels, with real-time predictions displayed in the app.
